This vignette demonstrates how to use the `count_by_period` function to aggregate recruitment data by specified time periods (week, month, or quarter) using a BigQuery dataset connected via **dbplyr**.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following packages installed and loaded:

```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "dbplyr", "bigrquery", "DBI", "rlang"))

# Load the necessary libraries:
library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)
library(bigrquery)
library(DBI)
library(rlang)
```

## Establishing a Connection to BigQuery

First, establish a connection to your BigQuery project and dataset.

```r
# Define your project and dataset IDs
project_id <- "nih-nci-dceg-connect-stg-5519"
dataset_id <- "FlatConnect"

# Establish the connection
con <- dbConnect(
  bigrquery::bigquery(),
  project = project_id,
  dataset = dataset_id,
  use_legacy_sql = FALSE
)
```

## Referencing Your BigQuery Table
Use the tbl() function from dbplyr to reference your BigQuery table.

```r
# Reference the 'participants_JP' table in the 'FlatConnect' dataset
your_table <- tbl(con, "FlatConnect.participants_JP")
```

## Aggregating Counts by Week
Aggregate the number of records by week, with the week starting on Monday (default setting).

```r
# Aggregate counts by week
weekly_counts <- count_by_period(
  tbl = your_table,
  date_col = d_471593703,
  period = "week",
  date_type = "string"
)

# Collect the results into R
weekly_counts_local <- weekly_counts %>% collect()

# View the aggregated weekly counts
print(weekly_counts_local)
```

##### Example Output: 
```r
# A tibble: 109 × 2
   period_start        num_records
   <dttm>                    <int>
 1 2022-05-30 00:00:00           8
 2 2022-06-06 00:00:00          15
 3 2022-06-13 00:00:00          31
 4 2022-06-20 00:00:00           7
 5 2022-06-27 00:00:00          14
 6 2022-07-04 00:00:00          30
 7 2022-07-11 00:00:00          26
 8 2022-07-18 00:00:00          10
 9 2022-07-25 00:00:00          12
10 2022-08-01 00:00:00           2
# ℹ 99 more rows
# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

#### Show the SQL Query that was Generated
```r
weekly_counts %>% show_query()
```

```sql
<SQL>
SELECT `period_start`, count(*) AS `num_records`
FROM (
  SELECT
    `d_471593703`,
    TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(CAST(`d_471593703` AS TIMESTAMP), WEEK(MONDAY)) AS `period_start`
  FROM `FlatConnect.participants_JP`
  WHERE (NOT((`d_471593703` IS NULL)))
) `q01`
GROUP BY `period_start`
ORDER BY `period_start`
```

## Aggregating Counts by Month
Aggregate the number of records by month.

```r
# Aggregate counts by month
monthly_counts <- count_by_period(
  tbl = your_table,
  date_col = d_471593703,
  period = "month"
)

# Collect the results into R
monthly_counts_local <- monthly_counts %>% collect()

# View the aggregated monthly counts
print(monthly_counts_local)
```

##### Example Output: 
```r
# A tibble: 29 × 2
   period_start        num_records
   <dttm>                    <int>
 1 2022-06-01 00:00:00          70
 2 2022-07-01 00:00:00          83
 3 2022-08-01 00:00:00          29
 4 2022-09-01 00:00:00          48
 5 2022-10-01 00:00:00          65
 6 2022-11-01 00:00:00         171
 7 2022-12-01 00:00:00         192
 8 2023-01-01 00:00:00          20
 9 2023-02-01 00:00:00          31
10 2023-03-01 00:00:00          93
# ℹ 19 more rows
# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

## Aggregating Counts by Quarter
Aggregate the number of records by quarter.

```r
# Aggregate counts by quarter
quarterly_counts <- count_by_period(
  tbl = your_table,
  date_col = d_471593703,
  period = "quarter"
)

# Collect the results into R
quarterly_counts_local <- quarterly_counts %>% collect()

# View the aggregated quarterly counts
print(quarterly_counts_local)
```

##### Example Output:

```r
# A tibble: 11 × 2
   period_start        num_records
   <dttm>                    <int>
 1 2022-04-01 00:00:00          70
 2 2022-07-01 00:00:00         160
 3 2022-10-01 00:00:00         428

10 2024-07-01 00:00:00         121
11 2024-10-01 00:00:00           2
```

## Aggregating Counts by Week Starting on Sunday
Customize the aggregation to have weeks start on Sunday instead of the default Monday.

```r
# Aggregate counts by week starting on Sunday
weekly_sunday_counts <- count_by_period(
  tbl = your_table,
  date_col = d_471593703,
  period = "week",
  week_start = "SUNDAY"
)

# Collect the results into R
weekly_sunday_counts_local <- weekly_sunday_counts %>% collect()

# View the aggregated weekly counts starting on Sunday
print(weekly_sunday_counts_local)
```

##### Example Output
```r
# A tibble: 109 × 2
   period_start        num_records
   <dttm>                    <int>
 1 2022-05-29 00:00:00           8
 2 2022-06-05 00:00:00          15
